# Flower Recognition with YOLO

Welcome! This project focuses on creating a model to detect and classify different species of flowers using the YOLO model. Currently, the model is under development. Our main scripts are designed to facilitate the training of the model and to automate the creation and diversification of label text files for any additional data we incorporate.

## Steps

### 1. Downloading the Dataset
To begin, download the initial dataset from the following link:
[Flower Dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/drone-dbsja/flower_dataset-podcd/dataset/15)

### 2. Adding and Labeling Additional Data
After downloading the base dataset, we add more data as needed. Using the provided scripts, we automate the labeling process, creating `.txt` files for labels to expand our dataset.

### 3. Training the Model
We plan to train the model using various algorithms and learning rate values to optimize its accuracy and performance.

## Project Status
Our project is still in the development phase, and we aim to make continuous updates and improvements.
